This is a small project that enables users to log in to the LinkedIn platform. While using other scrapers, I observed that LinkedIn somehow detects these tools as bots and further prevents their usage by displaying captchas.

The scripts that I have built store cookies in a file during the initial login and then use these existing cookies for subsequent logins. This prevents multiple login attempts and hence prevents captchas from blocking our scripts.

As I'm new to coding, the code might appear messy :)
